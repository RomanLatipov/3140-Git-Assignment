This is a test file for assignment 2 task 1

###This file was pushed from my repository to Github along side it a basic text file with some text and a log file of all the commands that I used for task 1. Task 3 I believe that I completed completely. The csv file and the output life are in the 'Task 3' folder along witha log of the commands that I used to make it. I didn't upload all my logs as there was a lot of trial-and-error that went into making that long string of code. Task 2 I had the most trouble with. I created a repository on my home desktop but was unable to initialize it or add anything to the staging area. Everytime I would use commands like 'add' or 'commit' it woudld give me an error message saying that the repo is not a working copy. I spent days troubleshooting the issue but couldn't find any working solutions. Some very old posts from the host website has links to libraries and repos I was told to import but non off the links actually worked. I get how Subversion works; it's not too different from Git and would have probably gotten it to work had the links actually worked.
